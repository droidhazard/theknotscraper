    "vendorNotes": "Additional Booking Notes\nProvided that the ceilings are at least 15', Duo Rêves can perform aerial acts anywhere with a hard point that can hold 2000 lbs., anywhere with an exposed steel I beam (they can provide their own beam clamp) or anywhere with ceilings over 15' and a level surface underneath. Outdoor options are also possible - please inquire.\n\nActs need, at minimum, a 20' diameter of clear space underneath the point to perform in, and either stanchions and/or security personnel surrounding the performance area to ensure the safety of everyone present - especially spectators wandering into or underneath the performance area. Some shows may feature flashing lights and/or fog machines.\n\nThey need to have everything set up and be able to rehearse in the space at least 3 hours prior to showtime.\n\nThe performers require a clean and private area in which to prepare for the show, stretch, get into costume and makeup, etc. A dressing room with heat/AC for a warm-up space, including appropriate lighting, is needed at least two hours before the performance.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: All deposits are non-refundable in the event of cancellation by the client. If inclement weather prevents Duo Rêves from traveling to the venue, 1/2 of the deposit will be refunded. The remainder of the deposit can be used toward a rescheduled date.\n\nThe Fine Print:\n\nDuo Rêves will be happy to meet with you face-to-face for a complimentary initial site visit and consultation.\n\nUpon receipt of your deposit, Duo Rêves reserves the time and date agreed upon, and will not make other reservations for that time and date. For this reason, all deposits are non-refundable. If Duo Rêves cannot perform this agreement due to a fire or other casualty, strike, act of God, or other cause beyond the control of the parties, Duo Rêves shall return one-half of the deposit to the client but shall have no further liability with respect to the agreement.\n\nOnce you have chosen to hire Duo Rêves and they have received your non-refundable deposit, they will work with you to create your show. They always aim to make something magical and unique that you and your guests will remember for long after the party's over.\n\nPlease note: Duo Rêves is open to working within your event's theme in terms of color choices, musical genre and costuming, but they prefer to retain creative license over their look and the work itself.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all costuming, aerial equipment and additional supplies are the sole property of Duo Rêves. Any missing or damaged costumes, supplies, or equipment will be charged to the client.\n\nThe Client must ensure that the event venue is a safe and healthy environment for the performers. The Client must ensure that the event venue complies with all safety and health regulations as established in the city and county where event takes place (including fire/zoning/building/OSHA).\n\nThey will need a point of contact person for the venue to arrange rigging.\n\nDuo Rêves will arrive on time and prepared to perform at least 4 hours before the scheduled event and will check in with the Client’s point of contact to ensure all parties are in communication with each other.\n\nAll participants in this agreement are independent contractors and do not qualify as employees or agents of either entity. Each party mentioned in this contract is responsible for the reporting and payment of their taxes as a result of this transaction.",

Minimalistic design works well.\nIf available, a raised platform or stage enhances visibility for the audience. Consider backdrop elements that resonate with Marvill’s brand—perhaps a fusion of architectural patterns and musical notes.\n\nSound:\nMarvill performs with the Bose S1 Pro Plus portable PA speaker. Ensure it’s positioned optimally for balanced sound projection by providing an elevated surface or speaker stand. Connect the speaker via a standard XLR audio cable to other systems if a multiple-room sound is desired.\n\nInstrumental Tracks:\nMarvill’s playlist of instrumentals accompanies his live performance. If Marvill collaborates with a DJ, the songs must be in their original pitch and key signature.\n\nTravel Considerations:\nMarvill is wanderlust-friendly! Cover flight, hotel, and Uber expenses, and they’ll bring their magic anywhere.\nCommunicate logistics well in advance to ensure a seamless experience.\n\nRemember, Marvill Martin’s technical requirements contribute to the enchantment of their performances. 🎶✨",

Must be outdoors, not trees or shrubs nearby, nothing hanging from above that can burn when throwing the fire staff up. Preferably flooring be cement, concrete, a hard surface that will not burn, grass is ok. If it's semi-outdoor patio area, make sure to have good ventilation. For gas dipping, I will need a separate area away from the stage area but close enough so I can easily start the fire on stage. Stage space minimum 15'x10' , and people must not be closer than 20' from the performer all around.\n\nFace Painting:  Great for ages 3 and up .  I dress colorful , but can also dress in all white or all black if requested. I paint 10-12 kids an hour. Extra time (approved by client) will be $30 every half hour.\n\nKid's Games - Great for ages 5 and up. I dress very colorful and games last about half hour. (This is usually combined with a face painting or balloon twisting service)\n\nBalloon Twisting-  Great for ages 3 and up. Simple balloon animals from one to 5 balloons used per animal. See pictures for detail.\n\nKids Nursery Rhymes - Great for ages 2 and up. I dress very colorful and I play about 20 or so songs on the Ukulele. The music jam can last about half hour and can be unplugged or with amp and mic. These are classical kids songs like the Itsy Bitsy Spider, Hockey Pockey, and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star etc. (This is usually combined to a balloon twisting or face painting service)\n\nJuggling and Unicycle act - Great for ages 5 and up. Lasts about 10 minutes. I juggle with 3 to 5 balls, juggle rings and ride my unicycle and juggle. This is also only combined to a Balloon twisting or face painting service.",

I have performed on small stages before that were close to the crowd. I can perform my most amazing tricks on the bigger stages, especially ones that allow me to toss high.\n\nFor teaching, gear will be provided for guests to use; specifically for diabolo lessons I can accommodate a class size of up to 50. Gear will also be available for purchase for those interested in pursuing their practice further.\n\nFor fire performances I require approval from the venue as well as an open area clear of flammables to fire spin. I have my own fire extinguisher and duvetine blankets for fire safety. If you would like night entertainment but the venue doesn't allow fire I have LED juggling props that would be a perfect alternative.",

So it is important that California Clown has a place to park where the kids will see his arrival.\n\nIf your party is at a public park he will drive right up to your party. Some parks are ok with that and some make him move the car. But he will always try to drive right up to the event.\n\nThe magic carpet will need the help of four or five adults or a couple adults and a few teenagers. It can be used inside or outside. But outside is much much better. If inside a minimum of ten feet distance from floor to ceiling is required.\n\nNot much space is required for the performance. Just enough that the kids can sit or stand to watch the show. There is a lot of interaction with the kids, so they should be sitting or standing fairly close to the performance.\n\nFor yard games such as sack races, tug o war, parachute, three legged race, relay races, etc. The more room the better. Parks and large yards are best.",

We have been teaching face painting for over 30 years for clown camps, clown alleys, kids’ camps and conventions all over the East Coast.\n\nPeppermint creates the popular animal faces, monster creations, half face designs, and also provides the latest glitter tattoos for guests who desire longer-lasting patterns.  Water-resistant face painting is available!!!  You can SWIM, SWEAT, and PLAY and NOT lose the artwork but the paint comes off with make-up remover or baby oil. Professional flash boards, kiosk, seating, signage, lighting, backdrop, and shelter can all be provided, if needed, for large events.  We also offer balloon sculptures for special occasions. Custom glitter and mica tattoos can be made at no additional charge for your event!\n\nDuring the holidays, Revolution celebrates Halloween with our original witch, Forsythia.  As versatile as you would have her be, Forsythia is a well-established character who was created for the North Carolina Zoo's Boo at the Zoo and Nightmare events and performed for eight seasons.  The character is a mix of the humor of The Addam’s Family’s Mama with the dramatic flair and sneakiness of Hocus Pocus’ Winifred Sanderson.  She wears a delicious, flamboyant costume of green silk, black velvet and flaming red hair.\n Forsythia is our Halloween treat and is approachable by all ages.\n\nFinally, there is Mary Kringle.  Christmas is not complete without the beautiful wife of Santa.  Whereas some children may be apprehensive about meeting the Big Guy, Mary brings the Spirit of Christmas with her beautiful red velvet gown and special walk-around surprises to the youngest guests.  She face paints holiday patterns, makes unique holiday balloon sculptures, provides holiday or event-specific glitter and mica tattos, and adds comedy spice to every family or corporate holiday event.\n\nAll characters are available for birthday parties, too.  Our rates are based on where we’re going, what we’re doing, and how many guests will be in attending.  Revolution books on a first come, first serve basis.  Contracts and deposits are required for every event.",

Required by our insurance, Made and endorsed by 10 time World Champion Martha Josey Barrel Racer.\n\nWe can not ride the children during lightening or high winds or heavy rain at all. This is for the safety of the animals and all the children attending the event including ourselves.  In case of a sever storm Please see our rain date cancellation policy and re book schedules.\n\nWe ask that the music not be extremely loud around the horses as it does bother their ears and can cause issues while walking the children. We must walk the horse's & ponies on a flat ground of grass or dirt. We do not walk our horses in the streets or sidewalks or parking lots with children on their backs for the safety of the horses feet and legs and the safety of a child if the horse was to spook at anything.\n\nWe look forward to speaking to you soon and meeting all of your family & friends at the next special event you host.",

Outdoor options are also possible - please inquire.\n\nActs need, at minimum, a 20' diameter of clear space underneath the point to perform in, and either stanchions and/or security personnel surrounding the performance area to ensure the safety of everyone present - especially spectators wandering into or underneath the performance area. Some shows may feature flashing lights and/or fog machines.\n\nThey need to have everything set up and be able to rehearse in the space at least 3 hours prior to showtime.\n\nThe performers require a clean and private area in which to prepare for the show, stretch, get into costume and makeup, etc. A dressing room with heat/AC for a warm-up space, including appropriate lighting, is needed at least two hours before the performance.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: All deposits are non-refundable in the event of cancellation by the client. If inclement weather prevents Duo Rêves from traveling to the venue, 1/2 of the deposit will be refunded. The remainder of the deposit can be used toward a rescheduled date.\n\nThe Fine Print:\n\nDuo Rêves will be happy to meet with you face-to-face for a complimentary initial site visit and consultation.\n\nUpon receipt of your deposit, Duo Rêves reserves the time and date agreed upon, and will not make other reservations for that time and date. For this reason, all deposits are non-refundable. If Duo Rêves cannot perform this agreement due to a fire or other casualty, strike, act of God, or other cause beyond the control of the parties, Duo Rêves shall return one-half of the deposit to the client but shall have no further liability with respect to the agreement.\n\nOnce you have chosen to hire Duo Rêves and they have received your non-refundable deposit, they will work with you to create your show. They always aim to make something magical and unique that you and your guests will remember for long after the party's over.\n\nPlease note: Duo Rêves is open to working within your event's theme in terms of color choices, musical genre and costuming, but they prefer to retain creative license over their look and the work itself.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all costuming, aerial equipment and additional supplies are the sole property of Duo Rêves. Any missing or damaged costumes, supplies, or equipment will be charged to the client.\n\nThe Client must ensure that the event venue is a safe and healthy environment for the performers. The Client must ensure that the event venue complies with all safety and health regulations as established in the city and county where event takes place (including fire/zoning/building/OSHA).\n\nThey will need a point of contact person for the venue to arrange rigging.\n\nDuo Rêves will arrive on time and prepared to perform at least 4 hours before the scheduled event and will check in with the Client’s point of contact to ensure all parties are in communication with each other.\n\nAll participants in this agreement are independent contractors and do not qualify as employees or agents of either entity. Each party mentioned in this contract is responsible for the reporting and payment of their taxes as a result of this transaction.",

So it is important that California Clown has a place to park where the kids will see his arrival.\n\nIf your party is at a public park he will drive right up to your party. Some parks are ok with that and some make him move the car. But he will always try to drive right up to the event.\n\nThe magic carpet will need the help of four or five adults or a couple adults and a few teenagers. It can be used inside or outside. But outside is much much better. If inside a minimum of ten feet distance from floor to ceiling is required.\n\nNot much space is required for the performance. Just enough that the kids can sit or stand to watch the show. There is a lot of interaction with the kids, so they should be sitting or standing fairly close to the performance.\n\nFor yard games such as sack races, tug o war, parachute, three legged race, relay races, etc. The more room the better. Parks and large yards are best.",

(Note: Noah is very flexible and can perform on almost any stage indoor or out. However, indoor shows are preferred as elements such as wind and rain can affect the overall length and quality of the show)\nA Public Address (P.A.) system appropriate for the venue. There should be 3 available XLR or 1/4” plug-ins. (Note: Noah can still set up even if there is only 1 available XLR or 1/4” outlet but the quality of the sound may be impacted and the artists must be notified so they can bring the appropriate equipment)\nBasic lighting for the stage: A blue & lavender wash set at about 65% is preferred. If in doubt, more lighting set at a lower intensity will be superior to a few lights set at a high intensity. (Note: Spotlights/Follow Spots are very challenging to juggle under and should be avoided if at all possible.)\nArtists will provide:\nMicrophones and Audio Ape system for controlling their music.",

The height of this point must be at least 16ft.  If the height of the attachment point is higher than 30ft, please mention this in your initial contact. Regardless of listed rating, I will always retain the right to refuse to perform if I do not feel safe and comfortable with the provided rigging point. Inspection of the rigging point prior to the event is suggested in order to avoid any confusion.\n\nFor outdoor, or large indoor venues, I can supply freestanding rigging for an additional fee. \nThe rig requires a 30x30ft unobstructed ground area and 25ft height clearance. The rig does have an option of a lower setup, which requires a 25x25 unobstructed ground area and 17ft height clearance. This arrangement would be best used for ambient/atmospheric aerial hoop or aerial sling performance.\n\nStilt Walking Requirements:\nIn order to perform stilt walking in your venue, I will need a minimum ceiling height of 10 feet, and relatively flat terrain.",

The height of this point must be at least 16ft.  If the height of the attachment point is higher than 30ft, please mention this in your initial contact. Regardless of listed rating, I will always retain the right to refuse to perform if I do not feel safe and comfortable with the provided rigging point. Inspection of the rigging point prior to the event is suggested in order to avoid any confusion.\n\nFor outdoor, or large indoor venues, I can supply freestanding rigging for an additional fee. \nThe rig requires a 30x30ft unobstructed ground area and 25ft height clearance. The rig does have an option of a lower setup, which requires a 25x25 unobstructed ground area and 17ft height clearance. This arrangement would be best used for ambient/atmospheric aerial hoop or aerial sling performance.\n\nStilt Walking Requirements:\nIn order to perform stilt walking in your venue, I will need a minimum ceiling height of 10 feet, and relatively flat terrain.",

    "vendorNotes": "Additional Booking Notes\nThank you for your interest and consideration in having Peppi bring comedy for your event.  Booking a comedian is somewhat different than booking a musician or speaker. But the results can be so enjoyable for the audience, and rewarding for you, the coordinator.   It is our hope that this information will not only help to make it as easy on you as possible, but to get the audience ready to laugh, so they don't have to be awakened from a coma with Peppi's first joke.\n\nIn a nutshell, all that is necessary for a spectacular comedy show are the following:\n1) Well-planned and early (and often) advertisement primes the audience long before the show date ever arrives.  Get them pumped up that \"A COMEDIAN IS COMING!\"\n2) Make the show distraction-free (Ages 7 & up, serve meal prior to or after show, close down any other activity in the room such as silent auction, craft sales, unplug noisy vending machines, indoor shows only,  etc.)\n3) Make the comedian easy to see and hear by all (sufficient sound system, adequate lighting that doesn't cast weird shadows on comedian's face, etc.)\n\nAll  Peppi requires is :\n\n1) Two (2) microphones, one is for Peppi's ukulele, or you may provide a 1/4 adapter for her cord.  If cordless mics, fresh batteries are a must.\n2) Two (2)  mic stands that allow for the mics to be placed into and out them of easily\n3) A bar stool with a hard seat, for Peppi's water bottle, and a small prop box\n4) Two (2) room temperature bottles of water\n5) Someone to operate sound system during the show\n6) A large screen with DVD projector & laptop (or computer) allows Peppi to bring some really funny additional media on her USB jump drive.  But it is not necessary.  She has plenty of material without it.  Please let her know if you have this capability.\n7) If over 300 people, projecting comedian onto the large screen allows everyone to be able to see better.\n8) If a meal is served before or following the event, please provide one for Peppi and her traveling companion also.",

    "vendorNotes": "Additional Booking Notes\nTo set things up for maximum impact, you would want to have quality audio and lighting.  Audio would involve wireless over-the-ear or lapel mics for each comedian (we usually travel with 3-4 comedians) and one or two handheld mics (wired or wireless, doesn't matter) and often a connection for a computer for music cues or a keyboardist/musician.  We can provide more detailed information following booking.\n\nFor lighting, a bright stage is best.  Audience lighting can be lower, but because of the interactive nature of our shows, we will need to be able to see the audience for certain aspects of the show.\n\nWe can be flexible with staging, but the best staging will be a clear, rectangular area with about 10-12 feet depth and about 20 feet width.  Bumpout areas can be worked with, but are not preferred.  Raised stages work best.  Usually there is no need to move everything off stage (i.e., drum kits, etc.).\n\nIf video projection is available and not needed for audience viewing (usually recommended for audiences over 750 or so), we have video loops that can serve as an attractive backdrop.",

Or 2) Close- up/Walkaround magic which gives people a more personal and more undeniable way to see and be a part of the entertainment that happens.\n\nFor smaller parties of 1-30 people I recommend my close-up show. An hour and a half of magic in the style most can only see in LA's famous magic castle. This is close up magic at its finest!\n\nBirthday parties, schools, and festivals I always recommend my kids show. Don't be decieved by the title, this is a show for all ages! It is kid focused. I make every kid a star and give them a part of the magic all while making the adults chuckle and \"awe.\"",

Then maybe after I help with the birthday song as we cut the cake, the interactive show begins. All I need is a 5 by 7 foot area to set up my equipment, which mostly includes just my keyboard and guitar. In most cases I will need shade for outdoor shows and I can bring my own portable power supply if an electrical outlet is not handy. So get ready to sing and dance and HAVE FUN!!!",

I can however perform indoors with Fire Eating.\n\n- Is this a public or private venue?

    "vendorNotes": "Additional Booking Notes\nSTAGING:\nHula Āfi has plenty of experience adjusting to small and/or unique performance spaces.\nIt is preferable to send photos and videos of the performance space prior to the day of service so that a safe performance may be prepared.\nPlease keep in mind that Hula Āfi performers will be barefoot, so barefoot-friendly surfaces are recommended.\nIf a safe surface cannot be provided, Hula Āfi will provide their own safe surface upon request.\nHula Āfi also provides Polynesian themed backdrops and props for rental upon request.\n\nLIGHTING:\nHula Āfi is able to provide stage lighting, no outlet needed.\nUsually, lighting is not required for Hula Āfi performances.\nIf lighting is needed, Hula Āfi will provide lighting free of charge.\n\nSOUND:\nHula Āfi supplies bluetooth speakers and microphones free of charge, no outlet needed.\nLive Polynesian drumming is often included in Hula Āfi performances.\n\nFIRE PERFORMANCE AND LIABILITY INSURANCE:\nHula Āfi's insurance policy and/or certificates will be provided upon request.\nPlease understand that certificates are venue-specific, so an address must be provided to Hula Āfi first, and certificate requests can take 2 business days to process through the insurance agency.\nPlease take this into consideration if there is a time-sensitive performance request.\n\nDEPOSIT:\nHula Āfi requires a non-refundable deposit in order to book services.\nThe deposit amount varies depending on the total cost of the performance.\nIn the event of an emergency, clients are more than welcome to reschedule their performance as long as Hula Āfi is notified ASAP.\n\nOVERTIME:\nHula Āfi charges an overtime fee of an additional $25 per performer, per half hour that they are needed past the performance time period after it has been confirmed and performers are physically on-site.\nHula Āfi allots a half hour \"grace period\" before charging the overtime rate, and will always notify clients prior to entering the overtime rate.\nFor example, if on the day of the performance, Hula Āfi performers are on-site and scheduled to start at 7pm, the client may push the performance back to 7:30pm at no extra charge.\nIf the client wishes to start the performance even later, for example, 8pm, the client will be charged an additional $25 per performer for overtime.\n\nCULTURAL APPROPRIATION AND SAFETY POLICY:\nHula Āfi does not tolerate cultural appropriation and will do their best to educate clients on how to avoid contributing to the exploitation of Polynesian culture.\nIf Hula Āfi performers notice something culturally problematic at an event, they will do their best to kindly notify the client and help make necessary adjustments.\nIf Hula Āfi performers are being harassed, disrespected, or feel unsafe in any manner, they will again, notify the client and aim to resolve the issue.\nIf Hula Āfi performers continue to feel uncomfortable or unsafe after conscious efforts to resolve the issue with the client, Hula Āfi performers reserve the right to refuse service and leave venue premises without issuing a refund.",

In order to ensure the integrity of our performance and the safety of our dancers, please be advised that we request the following:\n\nDance surface\nClient ideally should provide a dance floor. For our *optimal show we recommend a hard wood dance floor. If the dance surface is not wood or marley, we must be informed and approve of the dance surface before accepting gig.\nThe dance surface should be no smaller than the minimum dimensions specified by us, which will depend on the number of dancers in the performance and type of dances demonstrated.\nRecommended minimum floor dimensions:\n2 couples: 12’ X 18’\n3 couples: 14’ X 24’\n4 couples: 16’ X 30’\n*Optimal – Due to the nature our dances, flooring is of great importance for us to showcase our footwork at it’s best. Some of our routines also include acrobatic lifts, tosses and other fancy tricks many of which require the optimal flooring situation.\n\nDressing/changing area\nClient should provide a dressing/changing area for dancers. The dressing area should include table, chairs, mirrors, functioning electrical outlets, lighting, hanging rack for costumes, private bathroom and/or sink/washing area. If any of these items are not available, we must be informed in advance of the situation.\nWe request that the changing area be near the dance floor for ease and efficiency of costume changes. However, if this is not possible, please inform us of distance between dressing area and the “stage”, and configuration of performance area (e.g., whether there will be a backstage area, etc.).\nWater/Food\nClient must provide drinking water for dancers for any length event whether a 15 min show or 1.5 hr show.\nSuggested Guidlines: 2 liters per dancer, in dressing area, before or upon arrival of dancers.\nIf our performance terms require our presence at your event for a period beyond 3 hrs, we will likely need to have food available to us especially if we are travelling from out of town. If you will be providing eats, we suggest healthy nutritious foods like whole fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes and whole grains as they are always appreciated by our health conscious dancers.\n\nSound and Floor Check\nWe request a window of time ending no less than 1 hour before performance is scheduled to start in order to run through the performance on the dance floor. We need this time to do sound check and to assess the quality of the dance floor in order to make any necessary last-minute adjustments\n\nVideotaping\nIf you are interested in having our performance videotaped, that should be discussed prior to the event. We generally are happy to have our show videotaped provided we are provided with a copy of the raw footage and/or final edited results. Please keep in mind that any broadcasting or distribution of our performance must be approved by us. We reserve all rights to our performance and still images.\n \nThank you, and enjoy the show!!!",

One of the biggest challenges is the thousands of settings and variables that you can select to change the sound. We have built our band around our QSC TouchMix 30 Digital Mixer that has an incredible amount of intelligence built into the mixer. It allows us to best calibrate the sound depending on the venue size and allows us to save sound configurations so that we can recall those settings with the touch of a button. What that means for you as a customer is a high caliber live sound for Radio Royalty and doing it while reducing the set up time for the band.\n\nThe PA Speakers and the subwoofers we use all also QSC products. We use QSC K12.2 for the PA speakers and QSC KS112 for the subwoofers. The advantage of an all QSC system is that we are able to utilize preset settings created by QSC that can maximize the sound. These presets were compiled by feedback from thousands of hours of professional sound engineering that helps us tap into this knowledge of the PA system by simply telling the mixer what QSC speakers we are using.\n\noQSC TouchMix30 digital mixer\noTwo QSC K12.2 PA Speakers\noTwo QSC KS112 Subwoofer\n\nRadio Royalty has upgraded all of our cables in the band to the highest quality Canare Stage cable with gold-tip Neutrik connectors for every cable we use on stage. In addition, we use a high-end Shure wireless In-Ear Monitor system that allows each band member to adjust the sound mix exactly as they need it. This helps keep stage noise for the band t a minimum. Lastly, our band has a professional sound engineer that we hire for larger shows. He has been working with the band for a while and has a good understanding of the equipment we use.",

If no piano or rented piano is provided, JD (with advanced agreement and small additional fee) will provide his own electronic keyboard, either his Yamaha Motif ES, Roland FP 3 (88 key professional instruments).  When added sounds such as drums, brass, strings, organs, etc are desired to embellish JD's one person performance, he brings along his preferred entertainment extra keyboard, the Yamaha PSR-530.\n\nJD has two levels of portable sound he provides for his music, a smaller Bose speaker sound (visually non-obtrusive, ideal for venues like private house parties), or two powered Studio Speakers (18\"x26\") on stands. And in some events, both systems are necessary to distribute the sound, for instance, to another room or outside to the garden.  In either case, JD brings a small mixing board with a microphone, which can be used by singers, for announcements and toasts, etc.\n\nQuiet Portable Power is something JD is ready to provide, converting a 12 volt battery into household current for running his keyboard, amplifying his guitar (when called for), for singing and for officiating, announcements, etc.",

A business that is a registered Licensed LLC represents legitimacy and authority. Consumers, vendors, and partners frequently prefer to do business with an incorporated company.\n \n \nCustomized Contract:\nTell Us and We Deliver.    We are known for developing creative event packages customized to our clients' needs. We can create or customize the entertainment for various special occasions, such as weddings, children’s birthdays, corporate events and concerts.\n \nFull Liability Insurance:\nWe Protect Our Customers.  Entertainment liability insurance is imperative for any entertainment company, individual or entertainer. Many events are out of the hands of event promoters, but the liability remains in the hands of those that are throwing the event. Be it weather or accident, injury or disaster, it is important to prepare for the worst. If you are holding any sort of entertainment event, it is important to make sure that you are protected against those actions which are simply outside of your control. \n \nWe Accept All Major Credit Cards:\nFor Your Convenience.  Accepting credit cards and debit cards is a popular, flexible, and stress free payment option offered by legitimate businesses. Some customers prefer to use their credit card to minimize payment processing on their end and, potentially, to get whatever rewards or incentives that are associated with their card.\n \nNo-Obligation Appointments:\nWhat You See is What You Get.  Book a no obligation appointment for free, at our studio location with our featured tribute artist and staff members. We will talk to you about your special event and provide you with a quote. There are no obligations and you do not need to proceed with booking if you do not wish to.\n \n100 Client Verified Video Reviews:\nReal People = Real Reviews. USA Today and The NY Times have released several reports about individuals posting Fake Online Reviews on various high profile entertainment websites. A Verified Buyer is an individual who has purchased the reviewed the entertainer and submitted their review through a specific process that tracks purchase history. Our reviews are recorded live on camera, accompanied by the client's name and location of event.\n \nMajor TV Network Appearances:\nAs Seen On TV.  Media, TV and film appearances are professional and highly relevant credentials in hiring a reputable entertainer.\n \nUnedited Performance Videos:\nFull Show Footage is Available. In addition to promotional commercials and show reels, all professional agents, corporations and entertainers offer extended and unedited show footage. Inquire for the full show DVDs and/or video links.\n \nMale Tribute Artist(s):\nOur Performers. Currently our MJXpressions roster represents all male tribute artists.\n \nPayment Plan Options:\nChoose the payment plan that best fits your needs.

She was very personable and outgoing. Never at any point was she lacking energy and enthusiasm. She was \"on\" 100% of the time. \nChristina was punctual and ready to go on time. Her costumes were very authentic and well-presented. \nShe even went out of her way to bring an iPod and speaker to play some Britney tunes at our booth -our crappy speaker malfunctioned within a half hour.\nShe taught our CEO a few dance moves and we got some great video evidence that we will hold over him forever :)\nThank you so much for sending us such a great talent. She seriously went above and beyond our expectations. \n-Marijo \"MJ\" Adamcik, DC\nMedical Division Manager Rocktape, Inc.\n\n“Christina and Todd were great! They were a lot of fun and very outgoing and will to talk to so many people. I don’t think we could have asked for better people or performers. They were always professional and very friendly to everyone they come into contact with. They were a real hit!”\n Autumn, Camichael Lynch, Minneapolis MN\n \n“Well, my parents surprised me with this for my graduation and I’ll just say that she was amazing. She moves, sings, and acts just like the real Britney Spears. She will definitely make it to the big time—I know it! Thanks for doing such a great job at my party–You made it even more memorable” Vince P.\n \n“She was fantastic at Chad’s Bar Mitzvah. The kids were wowed by her performance. Cindy, Chad, Jason, and I were overwhelmed by her talent, great job. Contributed to a fabulous night! Thank You.” Jeff G.\n \n“I surprised my daughter Lindsey for her birthday to have a Britney Spears impersonator. She was thrilled and so were all of her friends. They were all dancing and singing and loved every minute of it. They even followed her out to the car because they didn’t want her to leave. She is a great performer.” Helen K.\n \n“She was wonderful, She looked just Like Britney and her dancing was very professional. The girls loved her and somehow she even had the boys wanting to participate. I highly recommend her for your next party.” Elizabeth D.",

Having a screen or projector is best; low-hanging projectors are best on the side of the stage and not in the center.\n3. Headset or lavalier microphone is preferred; smaller rooms/groups won't need a microphone.\n4. Want to record? Just let the team know, and we'll let you know the parameters.\n5. Did we mention flexibility? Let us know if there is a last-minute adjustment to the timing, if we can accommodate, we will.\n6. Best not to have wait staff serve food or clear plates during the presentation.\n7. If Ari is to be joining for any meals, please inquire about dietary requirements.\n8.
